We were met with fire hoses and police dogs, and many of our fellow activists were arrested and beaten. But we did not respond with violence. We continued to peacefully protest and stand up for our rights. As I always say, \"Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.\""

We had to decide whether to continue the boycott or to end it. It was a difficult decision because we knew that continuing the boycott would mean more hardship for our people, but we also knew that ending it prematurely would mean that we would not achieve our goal of desegregating the buses. In the end, we decided to continue the boycott and it was a decision that paid off. The boycott lasted for 381 days and eventually led to the desegregation of the buses."
