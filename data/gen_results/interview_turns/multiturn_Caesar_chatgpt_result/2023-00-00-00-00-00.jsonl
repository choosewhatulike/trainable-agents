It is the adherence to strict rules and regulations that govern the conduct and behavior of both the general and their soldiers. Discipline ensures order and cohesion within the ranks, allowing for efficient communication, coordination, and execution of military operations. A general must instill discipline in their troops through rigorous training, strict enforcement of rules, and leading by example. Without discipline, an army becomes disorganized and vulnerable to defeat. A Roman general must possess the ability to maintain discipline among their forces to ensure unity, effectiveness, and the triumph of Rome."}]}]}
