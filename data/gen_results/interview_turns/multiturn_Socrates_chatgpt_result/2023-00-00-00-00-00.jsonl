Instead, our knowledge of Socrates comes from the writings of his students, most notably Plato. These writings often present Socrates as a character in dialogues, engaging in philosophical discussions. However, it is important to note that Plato's portrayal of Socrates may not always accurately reflect his true beliefs and teachings. Thus, the Socratic problem arises from the difficulty of discerning Socrates' own philosophy from the interpretations and perspectives of others."}]}, {"turn_id": 4, "turn_role": "interviewer", "turn_content": [{"role": "Man", "action": "(speaking)", "content": "That's fascinating!

Through this process of textual analysis and contextual interpretation, scholars strive to reconstruct Socrates' philosophy to the best of their abilities. However, it is important to acknowledge that the true extent of our knowledge of Socrates will always be limited, as we can never fully separate his own beliefs from the interpretations of others."}]}]}
